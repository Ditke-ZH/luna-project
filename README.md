Our second Full-Stack project at Constuctor Learning was the Luna Project where we put our Front-End and Back-End Web Development knowledge into practice.

Introducing the Luna Project, a transformative endeavor aimed at modernizing Yelp's technology stack. With a focus on Python/Django and ES6/React, alongside a dynamic UI overhaul, the project addresses Yelp's need for innovation. This initiative involves assembling a new team to develop a prototype aligned with wireframes. The Luna Project features encompass seamless user registration, profile management, login/logout, and more, catering to diverse needs. Technical excellence is ensured through Docker integration, deployment automation, permission controls, clean code practices, and comprehensive documentation, promising an enhanced Yelp experience.
